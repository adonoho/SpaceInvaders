# Space Invaders
Austin Apple TV Hackathon Space Invaders.

Implemented to learn both SpriteKit and AppleTV. Based upon [Ray Wenderlich's Team's tutorial implementing Space Invaders in SpriteKit and Swift](http://www.raywenderlich.com/76740/make-game-like-space-invaders-sprite-kit-and-swift-tutorial-part-1) by [Riccardo D'Antoni](http://www.raywenderlich.com/u/Riccardo).

Jointly implemented for the Apple TV during the Hackathon by [Andrew Donoho](https://github.com/adonoho), [Jena Grafton](https://github.com/divaplavalajena), [Robert Murray](https://github.com/robertmurray) and [Matthew Waller](https://github.com/MatthewWaller). Later polish and finish by Andrew as an alternative implementation in Swift v2.0. We believe it is slightly more idiomatically Swift than the original tutorial.
